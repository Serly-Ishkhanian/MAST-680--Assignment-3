# MAST-680-Assignment-3
The aim of this assignment is to use the Lorenz equations to train one neural network that takes the solutions (the state variables) to the next and works for three different parameter values. We will observe how we can find the best loss function, how far into the future the predictions remain accurate on the specified parameter values, the effects of manipulating the timestep between the states, and the ability of the neural network to predict the future state variables for parameter values outside the training data.
